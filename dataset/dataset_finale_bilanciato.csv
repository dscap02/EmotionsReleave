"This was funny the first time, now this jokes been beaten to death so badly.",17
At least this makes me feel better about not being photogenic. It‚Äôs the cameras fault!,17
I dunno if that's really a HMB moment but funny nonetheless.,17
"You gotta use the footage that you got haha And yeah of course, my guy.",17
"You choose a bad time, no one is fessing up anything during an election.",17
"This is awesome! Do you want people to RSVP? Or are you doing this first come, first served?",14
You're right! I DO remember the refs being trash in that game as well! Thanks for the heads up!,0
"To be fair, they did call it a horror. ",14
I wonder how she would respond if he said this. It's almost worth doing to find out.... Almost,14
I literally have more friends on HOTS than WOW. Wow is deader than hots.,17
Yesssss!!! [NAME] would be awesome!!! I also alternate between these two shows! So good.,14
I laughed. Finally,17
Thank you... I'll try but can't promise anything,17
"[NAME] turned it into one, because they insisnt on being on the wrong side of history for every single god damn issue.",2

Hi [NAME] nice to see you,17

Funny bc random guys do that behind girls in clubs sometimes.,17
"So many players from the current crop are going to end up on 300+ games, crazy to think how exclusive it was not too long ago",17
We're all [NAME] fans in our hearts,17

"To me it looks like they were driving with both feet, as the brakes were on while they were accelerating... Something I will never understand.",6
Thank you! Does it contain clinical trails?,0
That's some wishful thinking if I choose to believe that lol,17
"This is great, thank you! I‚Äôll take a read and see what is still available.",14
"*youve doomed us all, evacuate the continent immediately*",2
NO GOD NOOOO!,14
Because in a world of fake people you need strangers being mean to get an honest opinion.,17
"But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad.",11
It's interesting that you don't address anything but just come to troll,2

[NAME] smashed some kitkats on their table for internet points. Very cool.,14
Thanks for the book recommendation!,0
That's why I'm glad they got [NAME].,17

I'll kill you.,2
"Wow, way to be gorgeous as yourself!",14
Haha. Thank you,17

He probably enjoyed it so much with his frat brothers that he's willing to buck his own party for good weed.,17
calling her a sellout for having a job is hilarious.,17
I see that you also braved the farmers' market this morning!,14

I usually see retarded stuff posted on this sub but yours takes the cake,0
Lullaby is excellent and so is Diary. His first 5 or 6 books are out of this world.,14

I love crows!!!!,0
I want to see the human equivalent to how happy this dog is,17
"He's both. An edgy neckbeard skinny fat, but he is undeniably funny. ",17

[NAME] saw it during the football game and was super impressed!,14
Thanks for the advice. It does presuppose that I am able to have that conversation with him though. Will give some thought to how to do it.,17

Wow i've sat like all of those,17
"What pieces of gear are they? That‚Äôs my dream build. Like what gear combination for head, arms, chest, weapons, etc",17
Did you mean all of Massachusetts or just Boston? Because I'm pretty sure Western Mass drives well.,0
Me too I hope all goes well for both of us,17
"I too have had this happen on XBONE. I really want to love this game, but it keeps giving me reasons to play something else.",0

She didn't believe that [NAME] left a Bomb. To [NAME] it could all be a trick to get her to come back.,10
That was never in discussion all Miami wanted was to get rid off the whole contract.,10
Nope. Love them. What do you find gross?,10

"Nope, nope, nope and HELL NOPE! ",10
To be fair he did apologize for that one after he learned what Pride was really about but I still wouldn‚Äôt recommend going near his Twitter anymore,10
That isn't the issue. The issue is shilling your channel.,10
Not my proudest fap,10
I just don't like our options in the off season.,10
The argument [NAME] is making is that expecting women to cook is considered sexist but expecting men to shovel snow is fine. It's about the double standard.,10
I don't think it's that simple. There was a lot riding on making 7 and taking too many risks probably isn't the best answer.,10
No. We wouldn‚Äôt have enough room to play them all and each of them would add like 10-15 mill in luxury tax. EACH.,10

"I dont like to give out my number before meeting. Maybe phrase it in terms of verbal convo.. eg phone,Skype etc",10

Don‚Äôt blame [NAME] there tf is he supposed to do if our wing can‚Äôt stay in front of their man,10
I don‚Äôt think so. The rest of her profile was completely serious. She had photos from art museums and discussed politics in her profile.,10
Can‚Äôt argue with that.,10
[NAME] does more than [NAME] so I'll have do disagree about that,10
"As a person who lives in NYC, I couldn't possibly agree more",10
Super fake news. This wasn't brought up when directly asked about it in previous testimony.,10
You just defended him with a bunch of doublespeak bullshit so I‚Äôm gonna have to disagree. You‚Äôre a fucking idiot.,10
Can't speak for the original commenter but probably not yours since I'd rather not be tortured for eternity for disbelief.,10
Uhhhhhhhhh well that's not good,10

"And Mac and cheese is shit too. If a grown man has to eat children's food, then STAHMs can get minimum wage jobs",10
Unable. It's not really possible. It's not his only interest but it's the one I can't really do anything about.,10
And please do not dab unless you are at bingo.,10
its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30,10
"Ah, alright. Solid lists, but I disagree with appointing a sitting [NAME] with only 2 years under his/her belt.",10
"It's 57% upvoted, which pretty much means most people hate it. ",10

All I'm saying is there is no way I would let one solo drop my whole team with a quad 0% chance,10
Plus corporations are universally unethical,10
Nah see that's the kind of pessimism that makes you more depressed. Even if they're not genuine you can still take it to heart.,10
I couldn‚Äôt live like this. You should leave.,10
It's not vague at all. No one aside from slave owners thinks anyone has a rightful claim to another persons life.,10
As it should be. No way I'd want my kid crossing 5 lanes of traffic to get to the bus everyday.,10
"Nah, this sub is for well put together unpopular opinions. This is too low effort.",10

Nobody likes you,10

You're giving fascism too much credit here. They were backed by capitalists in the first place because it was profitable. It's those two together.,10
"Let's not try to pretend both were equally bad, [NAME] was magnitudes worse",10
A news source putting out sponsored news is inappropriate. Stop reading BBC i guess,10
"[NAME] was my favorite. And I liked [NAME] her first season. They both suck now, so damn hard.",10
You can't just make bold claims like that and provide no evidence.,10
I hate [NAME] omg I just do,10
Not quite no. I don't pay attention to the leaks so I can't judge their quality.,10
The capitalist countries have welfare for those that can cope. The other countries dont.,10
I couldn‚Äôt live like this. You should leave.,10
"Well, I don't agree, but I do appreciate having a real discussion rather than just name calling lol. Agree to disagree",10
Too bad [NAME] is a bad person if abandoned and tries to kill you as well. Her singing was really nice..,10
Sex is not a right! Porn is not a right! Viewing naked female bodies is not a god damn civil liberty!,10
Not [NAME]. He really didn‚Äôt seem like the Canuck players that played with him missed him at all.,10

"But really though, it really contextualizes how bad this coaching search has been that the Rams' QB coach is the only guy we can be optimistic about",10
Star Wars fans? Backlash? Nah.,10
"From what I remember, a lot of the leafs fans had [NAME] from 8.5-9.25. I can‚Äôt recall someone saying 10+",10
That‚Äôs not true. She represents those who voted her into power.,10
No. This simply is not the case,10
I asked her before I told her. She took it on herself. I say NO all the time when I don't want to hear sadness and pain,10
I don‚Äôt believe the mislintat or the big joke parts,10

">the ad, which has been both criticised and applauded Applauded by non-customers. Criticized by customers.",10

"I wouldn't volunteer a second honestly. That weather is not worth it, and neither are your coworkers.",10
True but also it's not a dilemma ; if they try something like Tiananmen they will likely die. So not very tempting to try to change things.,10
Only married once so can't be that bad. Not that it even matters,10
For her? Nah,10
"Because it's a rejection of oneself, rather than acceptance. It's an expression of insecurity. It's not healthy.",10
I don't think that makes for a fair deal. That $100 is far more valuable. It's more of a disposable income thing for me.,10

no it is not the same. At the level of 3k in income then it may seem the same or trivial to bother with though.,10
"Yeah, that teacher was a disaster. She got fired a year later for just being an all around idiot.",10
Could not agree more!!,10
[NAME] was selfish as hell. Stop with the revisionist history bs,10
Nah let's not be those people.,10
I hate people.,10
Ok well I hate to break it to you but I'm a magical pink unicorn...posting something on the internet does not make it true,10
Yeah I don't think [NAME] even had to move his hands for that one. [NAME] and [NAME] also destroyed the precision QB challenge too.,10
It's not like it's a bad thing...,10
Not sure why you are getting downvoted for this comment. I really dislikes the Facebook type posts on this sub.,10
"At this point I am questioning your sanity, you compare a guy with 40/34 goal seasons to a kid who literally can't hit the net",10
It‚Äôs an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. [NAME] was incredible this week.,10
"No I don't, but I'm assuming they are true for arguments sake Why is more stress relevant or bad? ",10

Of course not. Why admit their circle jerk was wrong? They'll only learn the lesson after the lawsuit ends.,10
"Middle guy doesn't look to fit to me. Looks like me, too many pounds.",10
This is pretty bad advice. Do not use dreams own encryption. And do not use things such as igolder,10
No they shouldn't. Mental illness is a serious thing and we shouldn't encourage crazy people but instead help them,10

I feel bad for him and [NAME] i hate seeing the OGs fall #UNITEGAMING,25
And that's an issue. Councils are *so* unrepresentative it hurts.,25
Not look much beautiful.,25
I went to college to get an MRS and all I got was this lousy BS!,25
Six shots on goal for [NAME] and still nothing. This breaks my heart.,25
Losing to cruz azul smh,25

youve never played against a good support [NAME] then,25
I miss [NAME] and [NAME]. :(,25
[NAME] is getting very unhinged I almost feel bad for him at this point,25
Believe me when i say not having a job doesn't change anything. It's an endless nightmare being ostracized from people your whole life.,25
"Damn never heard of that, I stand corrected!",25
"Sorry, no. We‚Äôre just going to export [NAME] to you guys. ",25
She has major SBüòñ,25
It looks like someone screwed up.,25
I can‚Äôt translate /s to Texan speak well and forgot so my apologies y‚Äôall :),25

I'm so sorry,25
"Morocco sucks, I don‚Äôt blame you for not wanting to go",25
I always cry when [NAME] is on screen.,25
"> Because I was a disgracefully gullible, immensely stupid fucking dipshit ~~was~~ *am* FTFY",25
America can out-lazy your ass any day.,25
removed the bit calling you a right winger. Sorry.,25
Better late than never sadly I can see another label scooping him up,25
"I used to have no problems finding them, but I‚Äôm struggling really hard now",25
"Sorry I haven't been keeping up to date, what happens next week?",25
And unfortunately videos like this act as a constant reminder that most people are complete dumbasses. Sad really.,25
Goodbye cruel world.,25
i definitely remember the times i embarassed myself or regrettable actions i made from years ago,25
Aw crap you're right. Sorry I suck at names and shit,25
"Teacher: Huh, I never though he'd really do that.",25
Sadly the minimum wage in Virginia is only $7.25 an hour so that definitely would not be enough.,25
Totally and sorry for that,25
I'm just an idiot on the internet. I don't know a doggam thing.,25
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss... if you ever want to queue PM me for my steam,25
It is heated overnight at much cheaper rates. They are very well insulated.,25
That sub sounds boring as fuck.,25
"Yep. Tough week for [NAME]. Not shooting well, first ejection and fine, ripping out jerseys, first triple double and the DSJ drama. ",25
"Oh, that's horrible. My condolences.",25
And the problem is that they took doctors out of a&e and out patients and community services and gp's to pay for his monstrosity...,25
"I live in Suiderstrand, which is past Aghulas, no option for fibre here unfortunately :(",25
im still starving,25
I have cried in hotel rooms before thinking about the loss from discovering it is a lie. It's tragic and wonderful at the same time.,25
"That last bit is part of the embarrassment, actually.",25
But all this does is hurt the average person not the right way to raise money.,25
"I'm sorry, when did a subreddit become a sacred institution? That's a false equivalency.",25
Easy: he‚Äôs completely unrepresentative of Colorado and really bad at his job.,25
That entire family is so embarrassing.,25
This is awful and borderline abuse. I can't imagine thinking that's even slightly okay,25
> that hurts my enjoyment of society. Then what could you possibly mean by this?,25
Yeah but people are dumb and mesh everything together because thinking about specific situations is clearly too hard,25
"I couldn't let [NAME] become carver.. I regret it. [NAME] didn't deserve this, although he was fucking stupid to let his guard down",25
It was less painful than a bee sting! I felt so silly afterwards!,25
What's really sad is that [NAME] wants to outlaw gay dads. I'm literally shaking.,25
"Sorry, didn‚Äôt realize I was talking to a fan of the prestigious UCLA Bruins football program.",25

[NAME] type awkwardness that some thots go nuts for.,25

I can do that too but I have diarrhea,25
Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?,25
"Yes, I've noticed it too. Or the photo of the item won't load. This company is so shameful",25
[NAME] is there anything more depressing than being in a leafs gdt when the leafs are losing.,25
sorry mr brolobo,25
we were frauded the whole time about how pure she is. turns out she's actually trash.,25
"Sadly, it was not",25
"This is the sad truth for the exact reason he mentioned, they want a short fix to avoid doing this type of hard work.",25
What‚Äôs worse is that the judge and businessman are old college buds.,25
"Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof.",25
Oh shit lol I forgot to put ‚Äúashamed.‚Äù,25
"Sad really. Are they really that threatened by people speaking a language? We all speak English everyday, not like we do for sectarian reasons.",25
Go pursue that education. Let [NAME] wallow in her own sadness.,25
"I understand what he was trying to say, but [NAME] it came out badly.",25
"Gnarly ballsack is the technical term, I believe. Sadly, it's just a face beard.",25
"I am so terribly sorry you lost your dad to this horrendous disease. Judging by this photo, he had a terrific smile.",25
I miss being practically jello as a kid,25
"Honestly wish I could do this, I miss my long hair sometimes :(",25
My grandmother-in-law does this. I‚Äôm sorry to anyone in the Va Beach area.,25
Poor Target didn‚Äôt make enough millions during one of the most hectic Christmas seasons I recall in almost 2 decades. Gotta save that payroll though.,25
This is just a terrible joke,25
"The fact that ""TrueChristian"" and ""TrueChristianity"" are so [RELIGION] is extremely telling. The faith is dishearteningly fractured...",25
Struggling to find :(,25
"Damn never heard of that, I stand corrected!",25
"[NAME]* I'm not mad, just dissapointed.",25
"They hated him, because he told them the truth",25
Google image him. Hes NEVER had a good haircut.,25
Not look much beautiful.,25
I'm sorry my Baby [NAME] joke made you so angry.,25
Banner price is down to 100k donuts. And I still don't have enough..... (sad face),25
"I'm so disappointed you didn't include [NAME] ""I'm standing under the source of the bull shit"" [NAME]",25
That poor janitor.,25
"I‚Äôm still using a laptop from 2008, and until last month I was using a phone from 2013. Actually felt bad upgrading the phone.",25
I'm sorry *what*,25

I sorry didn‚Äôt want to disrespect peep but as i said i needs to be dark and about something i like,25
"The problem is your husband. If he prioritized you, he would have figured something out. I‚Äôm so sorry.",25
Worst feeling ever,25
Gaaahhh. That one would hurt.,25
I'm so sad.,25
That is utterly horrifying. I'm so sorry that your kindergarten teacher was such a heartless old bat.,25
"Damnit, you beat me to it.",25
I don't know why but every time I see a meme telling me how good I am it doesn't do anything and doesn't make me happy,25
I had to mute cause the sound was making me cry.,25
It‚Äôs definitely a massive problem for both of us. Attributing blame does nothing to solve the problem.,25
I am here to tell you that it really will work out okay! I have certainly felt like you before. It sucks to feel lonely.,25
Makes it a lot less stressful tho. Regretting staying up this late tho,25
I know it's easy for me to say because it wasn't me but money is money. We can always make more. Really sorry dude.,25
I feel bad for laughing at this now that the creator of Spongebob passed away a month ago.,25
"Last three times have been lost Final, won Final, lost ECF, which is insane. Just a shame that's over the course of 17 years",25
Everybody seems to be lost.,25
i'm so poor i don't even know any horse girls,25
i got a bump and a bald spot. i feel dumb <3,25
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss... if you ever want to queue PM me for my steam,25
They are the best but my office is so far away üòû,25
With a lot of severe brain damage after being beat back to life with an ugly stick.,25
I would of at least helped the poor guy. Throw some fire crackers at the dam thing,25
"More insults, [NAME] said my bit now all you have is a show that proves what I said to be the truth, nothing more nothing less.",25
Now I see why it takes me 30 minutes extra to get home if I miss an exit.,25
It‚Äôs really sad to see,25
This moment always reminded me of being a kid and turning on Nickelodeon only to find Nick News with [NAME]. Ultimate disappointment.,25
1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good,25
My only regret will be posting this on my alt account.,25
"don't know any [NAME], sorry",25
[NAME] missed it solely because they've moved from the Rookies vs Sophomores format.,25
Sorry. I read that as newly white and it cracked me up.,25
can I use I can't believe it's not butter because my boyfie doesn't make over 20k :(,25
Which is why not only did PR lose but RUP was not the first choice sadly even if it had won in BC :(,25

May you find and skin the perpetrator. My apologies to your family. ‚ù§,25
this is so sad Alexa play despacito,25
That sucks. I had to deal with something similar. Sorry you go through this.,25
"Just an employee, just stressed that it takes so long to save 10k for example and even that is nothing ! Should of brought more bitcoins",25
I'm ashamed it took me a while to get it,25
"Good catch. I guess I was just remembering the shift after the first debate. That's pretty sad, tbh. ",25
The lucky ones died quick,25
"[NAME] was such a disaster at OC, I really don't feel comfortable even implying he's in Schotty's league.",25
"I am sorry for offending you "" WoW yOu WoNt EvEn LeT mY cHiLd Go ThErE aGaIn"" how tf. Whoops didnt mean to reply lol",25

I'll miss [NAME],25
Ya uh that's gen Z sorry,25
"I was assaulted by my father once too. Please don‚Äôt hate yourself, it was not your fault. It was his doing. ",25
How about breaking into tears whenever one of your friends tells you they trust you because you never understood what trust meant,25
Huh. Siege is still a thing. I miss the old days. :(,25
"I do not, sorry! I am not talented in the ways of making/editing videos.",25
Also i think that person is really shitty and I‚Äôm sorry you experienced that. People are animals sometimes.,25
But then you regret it because you realize you secretly liked the attention. Just bottom things.,25
Are you being stalked by anti-vaxxers? I‚Äôm so sorry that sucks so much,25
"No it's propaganda we because r/politics only presents info, true or (usually) or otherwise info that is designed to hurts conservatives and help liberals. Propaganda",25
Falling for such low quality bait,25

Dude that was in like October abandon all hope,25
You called yourself a Met fan. THAT is embarrassing. Edit: called themselves a Met fan and didn‚Äôt know who [NAME] was AMD disrespected him.,25
Because we feed the shitty ones so there is no incentive to put in effort,25
>![NAME]. Apologies to the Hiyoko Best Girl gang but I could never get myself to like her...!<,25
This aged poorly,25
"You‚Äôre not going to win, so you have nothing to worry about. ",25
She just missed her shot at a champagne douche.,25
"as a Ducks fan, this thread makes me sad...",25
How many gallons do we need is my favorite so far. The sad part is that it was always pleasant.,25
"Darn. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. I honestly am out of ideas and I don't know what to do.",25
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. When do you graduate?,25
>It's not that I care Every reply now is you crying about being downvoted lol,25
The problem is that rent controls and the prevention of urban infrastructure expansion is killing city renters. Which is what most cities do.,25
That guy is gonna regret losing you the rest of his life. You know why i know this? Because i am him 30 years ago.,25
"don't know any [NAME], sorry",25

"This was a floating barge of bullshit bound to ignorance, which is headed for a recycle bin on my desktop.",25
I think they are tied together. It is very difficult to maintain desire if you cannot accept things about that person.,25
It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.,25
Ketamine is absolutely bizarre in high doses. I lack the words to really describe it. I've never felt so detatched from my own humanity.,25
My comment provided shame. I am nothing.,25
It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.,25

"I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious.",25
Very sorry for your loss.,25
"at this point if you couldnt figure out that most [NAME] here dont actually support [NAME], you must have some problems",25
> Then and only then might you receive ~~a tip~~ **whatever change we have leftover from our grand expenses.**‚Äù FTFY. Sadly.,25

"Yeah, I was very sad to read that!",25
Powerful stuff. I'm sorry I gave you this much time and credit.,25
No where was I blaming [NAME] for the lose but he didn‚Äôt help. I just dislike his game.,25
An accurate but depressing assessment of our political system.,25

I feel like I lost focus... I have not accomplished anything and the clock isn't really stopping,25
"I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. ",25
My condolences.,25
Apologies. My point still stands. A .8% lead is an insignificant majority at best. Saying one demograohic is most of the population is a bit misleading,25
"Yeah, that's why I'm not feeling like there's much I can do except vent.",25
Too bad =(,25
"I couldn't let [NAME] become carver.. I regret it. [NAME] didn't deserve this, although he was fucking stupid to let his guard down",25

I think I met you. Sorry if I was a bit standoffish.,25
Go pursue that education. Let [NAME] wallow in her own sadness.,25

Dude that was in like October abandon all hope,25
"It was pretty heart breaking, then the council came out and said they weren't going to collect them. Made a lot of people mad. ",25

"Sorry, I meant let them know outside of class.",25
"Seeing as how someone was raping her, it doesn't surprise me that much that the facility would be so negligent that they wouldn't notice the pregnancy.",25
I'm sorry you poop your pants every time someone mixes those words up.,25
I really hate ginger ale. With a passion. The scenario in that scene makes me sick to my stomach.,25
Well this all started Wednesday. But I‚Äôve been unhappy with my life for weeks now,25
Because learning another language is cultural appropriation. This people are pathetic.,25
I lost a six pack this way once. For a good year every traffic stop became a field sobriety test.,25
The school should make a list of sexual assaulters. The boys who engage in this should be shamed publicly.,25

Omg this.. completely relatable and depressing.. yay for us.,25
Aw poor kid. At least he has a bomb-ass name. Too bad he probably doesn't remember it anymore.,25
That entire family is so embarrassing.,25
Yea we‚Äôre actually pretty efficient on offense considering our personnel. Way better than I expected. The defense is just historically bad,25
"*concussion* *Trophy system kills it* *Another concussion* *Trophy system kills it* ""Yo guys watch me throw this cluster"" Honestly embarrassing ",25
Yeah I love the shenanigans he gets up to. Shame he hasn't been able to get up to much recently though.,25
I know and that made me sad!,25
Weird how he doesn't have to say the word review in order to spend the entire article reviewing,25
That's the same thing 8 year olds use to try and get my items in video games. The guilt and shame strategy... Pathetic.,25

It's an underrated drama which just got snubbed on [NAME],25
Sorry but this is too rad to be cringe for me. This is like if [NAME] was a general.,25
Totally fair. I would be sad in your situation. :( I hope you find it. You're not wrong to want those things!,25
Yeah I love the shenanigans he gets up to. Shame he hasn't been able to get up to much recently though.,25
Incels can't even get a pleb thing called sex. Sex is for [NAME] apparently.,25
I'm so depressed,25
"Sorry, didnt realize. Anyway an r/woooosh so...",25
"Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos.",25
Excuse my wording. I should‚Äôve said [NAME] all around game & unselfishness combined with [NAME] aggressiveness & scoring,25

It's an underrated drama which just got snubbed on [NAME],25
"Oh good grief! Put it away, [NAME].",25
Nice! I missed the Babybel.,25
[NAME] punches here are so desperate and have absolutely zero power in them. He was outclassed so badly twice in a row after such a dominant run.,25
"Well damn, sounds more reliable then shit like and all that",25

This actually happened but no one clapped,25
I'm sorry man sounds bad,25
I think I might like a front end web developer job but not positive since I've always been in healthcare/science,25
This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.,25
"This is such a lame idea. Instead of getting better and outplaying your opponent, you just want to make your opponent worse. Sad.",25
"What do you mean strap around the bulls nuts?!,!? Sorry not into rodeo things ",25
"the whole thing, it was just hard to describe/express given how it all happened and everything. ",25

"Sorry if I was insulting, I just took your post as some commie type smugly trolling how stupid [NAME] is ",25
"I was looking forward to seeing the new predator, this (the concept, not the spoiler) would have made me dissapointed, yet intrigued",25
It's hard to care about a woman dying from giving birth when you hate women in the first place.,25
Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.,25
Also not true. Germany had pervasive antisemetism long before [NAME]. Ignoring that error your argument is horrible and you should be ashamed.,25
Missing this roster üò¢üò¢üò¢,25
"Bay Area, sorry ;D",25
"Must be sad that you waste your time idolizing ""Pros"" and being a absolute poser in front of your freinds ",25

Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.,25
What a shame... she was passing really well too...,25

His wrists are too small ‚òπÔ∏è,25
"""And then I apologized and expressed remorse over the situation"" ",25
I had 175/1 back in March. About to go to Vegas again and it will be disappointing to only get 12/1 this time.,25

"Sorry, didn't know where else to put it",25
I watched my team get deep dicked in the natty. I understand,25
By that logic its seedy and insincere for google to act like they care about Homealone.,25
