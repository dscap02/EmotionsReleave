                       [NAME] has not been that impressive in my opinion. [NAME] seems like the clear-cut top guy.       0,10 edn85mv
          Well, that’s not a position many conservatives hold except for the [NAME], but I appreciate the honesty. 0,10,15,22 eeseq9l
It’s amazing what they can justify to themselves. I’m not sure if I can believe anything out of her mouth anymore.     0,6,10 ed0wl33

                            No, every movie shouldn't be like that. But a good protagonist is a good protagonist!        0,10 edjh97l

                            Great for him professionally, but the employees he takes the credit from? Not so much.       0,10 ee77jc9
                                       Considering it’s a much deserved promotion I can’t be mad in the slightest.       0,10 ee0jyae
                 The abilities look cool, but that trait is a little dull. It's almost exactly the same as [NAME].       0,10 ed3bdji
