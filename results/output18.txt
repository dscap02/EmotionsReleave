                                                     Hi [NAME], I love you, that is all. Can't wait to see you in Worcester in February!       17,18 ee8wndy
                                                           Haha, same bro. I am lvl 21 and still playing at least 4hrs a day. Loving it!       17,18 eet6xiw

                             [NAME] still got a little pop tho for calling for the match. Makes me smile that the crowd still loves her.       17,18 ef89vpr
                        I remember them looking very happy. I loved that they were there and seemed very happy about what was happening.       17,18 eeou68l
            I love when you get the text afterwards - my last donation apparently saved a life in Cairns! Really cheered me up actually.       17,18 ee9nbyn

                                                         Love it! It’s somewhat realistic. Maybe not that THAT degree, but I enjoyed it.       17,18 ed8gau9
                                              I enjoy the harsh throat hit, reminds me of cigs. Edit: Mango is still my favorite though.       17,18 eeobsvx

                               I don't even cook the steel cut! I just love the chewiness! I'm usually fuller longer with steel cut too.       17,18 eemm0du
                    [NAME] line of drool made me very happy I waited to watch this til I was eating dinner i love the power hour so much       17,18 edivkvk

                                                   Thins are my favorite and I will not apologize. It makes the flavor of the cookie shine through.      18,20 efge9g2
                        Still love [NAME]. Gave his heart to the Broncos for many years. Hope he can go out and win himself another ring this year.      18,20 ee9khqj

                                I love [NAME] so much, but honestly it's great news that they refused to go back to that system. Hoping for [NAME].      18,20 eduah44

                 That would be terrible. I liked the way private Practice ended (more or less) so hopefully [NAME] doesn’t go for something cliche.      18,20 efcu5nf
