                                         I'm actually surprised it stayed up. We already got a shitpost thread yesterday. I though the limit was one per week.    22,26 edt11nf
                                            Lots of physical intimacy and sex almost every time we met. Never suspected that this would ever become a problem.    22,26 edzsi1j

                                             Actually surprised it's still going. It was fairly fun from what I remember, albeit a bit rough around the edges.    22,26 eev5lbl
