Gotcha. I see my clarification above. I sincerely apologize that anything I wrote made you feel that you needed to enforce your boundaries.    5,25 ed4cscs
                     Constantly worrying about her and not feeling pleasure without her presence could be. You need to talk to a therapist.    5,25 eeuhfmp

                     [NAME] is a sensitive topic for me, so when she is brought up, sometimes I just go on a little tangent. My apologies.     5,25 ed6n60i
               Aw bummer. She lost her screenshot of the copy of a copy of bullshit articles handwritten in 1992. Somebody help a girl out.    5,25 efgk1x9
                             Make a doctor's appointment and say you are experiencing lack of sleep because of anxiety. Doesn't get easier.    5,25 edq9ij8
