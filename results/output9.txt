            Great show - up until the last half of the final episode. It was such a lackluster, disappointing ending for what was a great series.      0,9 ee2138x
                          They're really cute but I'd never in a million years own one because they literally smell like week-old pissed on rugs.    0,4,9 efh3jq2
                                               I just came off of watching all of his movies. Dear [NAME]. I love and hate them at the same time. 0,4,9,18 edojle6
                 Interesting read, thanks. Still a 40% bust rate. Sucks that someone's job is on the line with that high of a chance of failing.    0,9,15 ef1ftl5
                                                  Got the same pops! [NAME] a lot :) too bad I can barely play him, wish there was a Hwoarang pop   0,9,18 edyr7ey
    Honestly many of these games that they lost they didn’t even play poorly, to me they looked pretty good and just unfortunately lost the game       0,9 edz0ojt
                                                     It's a shame when a really attractive person does this to themself. Pretty eyes great smile.      0,9 eeppis0

                                            I know it's so amazing. Too bad all the people that hate the game haven't thought of giving it a try.      0,9 edzy8kc
