                                   Dude has come up big in big situations time after time. To doubt his talent and clutch ness is dumb.      0,3 edpupdk
       So far she seems pretty decent but I'm side-eyeing the hell out of him. His conduct at the restaurant was so bizarre and creepy.      0,3 eczh3g4
       I hated [NAME], but only because I thought he was good and played for the Cowboys. I feel the same way about [NAME] and [NAME].       0,3 eema2z5
                                 Screw that psycho lady. [NAME] is ridiculously adorable, OP, please give him gentle head pats from me!      0,3 ef4bbah
                                                                     Of course it was a smart move, it's only dumb if its the only move      0,3 ed6zcfj
Good to see this getting traction again. It really exposes [NAME] to be a useful idiot, and his supporters to be even dumber than that.    0,3,4 ed6fpvm
                                                           I slightly hate you for triggering my OCD but at the same time it‚Äôs glorious      0,3 eemsney
                                                       No way. [NAME] was annoying. Arizona left a huge gap in the cast, she was great       0,3 edvosxw
                                                         Thanks for being a brave troop, comrade. [NAME] annoys the shit out of me too.   0,3,15 ed70c2z
                                                                  That's cute, pizza*kitchen*! No, we call her Kitten to annoy her. :)       0,3 ede3407
                                                   Such a cute baby, and yet his life begins with stupid parents doing stupid stuffs...      0,3 eeyuvoi
                                    So smart it looks like he shut his fingers in the door. That‚Äôs a nasty bruise under his fingernail.   0,3,11 ef4cdxx
Piss off a small percentage to gain an even larger one? That's hardly unheard of. The amount of publicity alone for this is astounding.      0,3 ee687me
                                                It‚Äôs a fucking rockstar videogame, not an old west farm and hunting simulator you pleb.      0,3 ed5qq3v

                                                    Prosciutto pizza is nice, but how can you fuck it up so badly that it ends up here?      0,3 ef3mdi2

                                          That used to be my favorite view on the planet, but now it‚Äôs just rage. I can‚Äôt look anymore. 0,3,9,18 edw1i4a
                                          Actually it's touching and kind of beautiful. The only thing stupid and lame is your comment.      0,3 ee5w3ll
                                                           Your patience to find the perfect moment is... Please just let me slow clap.      0,3 ef09iur
                       It's amazing how utterly lacking in self-awareness this sub is, that it can upvote this without a hint of irony.      0,3 eea3xy2

            It's wonderful. Reminds us of the need for pragmatism and of course, just how much we've annoyed the [NAME] over the years.      0,3 eedleys
                                                    Yeah, this guy actually seems quite smart. (But a horrible and manipulative person)      0,3 edwryy0
                                                   This is what unions are for. The great only appear great because we are on our knees      0,3 efckz8n

                                     Hitting me. That just added another funny dynamic to it even though I wasn‚Äôt actually trying to hit her.    1,3 eev51ae
