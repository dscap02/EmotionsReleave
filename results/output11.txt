                           They’re both good towns. Personally, I prefer Westfield. It has a better downtown, better schools, and the traffic is less awful.       0,11 ed8o0g7

                                If you're talking about drinking, unless there's tea or coffee in it, gross.    11,20 efgi2zk
                That's the weirdest dream I've heard of, but maybe you just have a high midichlorian count 😂    11,20 eetnece
                                 Try painting a penis around the pothole. Seems to have worked in Manchester    11,20 eerpbz5
                    Probably the same thing the rest of us do, chuckle and ponder how it can get any worse 😂  1,11,20 eex29c9
That’s downright creepy. It’s as if he’s testing if $50 will keep you quiet if he does inappropriate things.    11,20 edmqc3y
     >It would also open the possibility of selling the [NAME] arms, I guess. That would be a terrible idea. 11,14,20 edai0iq
                 This is so repulsive and disgusting. The government needs to do more to protect organising.    11,20 efdtj4n
                      I guess its the 9th largest city in the country but it it weird to group them together    11,20 efh01da
            That’s terrible; I would be devastated. You had to get out of there though. I’m thinking of you.  5,11,20 eehquwb
       The truly great thing about this is how he looks down, disgusted, as if the comment were down there 😂  0,11,20 ed4iy7l

                                                 I didn’t think it was possible for one Twitter account to be so obnoxious, but here it is.     11,22 ee3a189
              The worst thing about this is, there is a good joke hiding deep down somewhere. Someone just used a jackhammer to retrieve it     11,22 ee6tbjw

                                I actually had to rewind a few times because I found myself getting distracted because I was kind of bored.     11,22 eef3thl

I was reading up last night and it's a mixed bag. Exercise can help with the depressive episodes, but it can make the manic episodes worse.     11,22 ee21s47

    Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.     11,25 eemv6pn
