She reminds me of my crazy sister. Just a ball of nervousness and constantly just on the verge of crying. 18,19,25 edwh798

                                             I used to have anxiety when calling people but I no longer have them at least just 20-30% anxiety. 19,22 ed2t4vt
How terrible. Imagine waiting this long only to die the day before release? I always get that minor anxiety before a highly anticipated album!! 19,22 ef6zoia
