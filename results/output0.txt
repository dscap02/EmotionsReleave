                                   Dude has come up big in big situations time after time. To doubt his talent and clutch ness is dumb.      0,3 edpupdk
       So far she seems pretty decent but I'm side-eyeing the hell out of him. His conduct at the restaurant was so bizarre and creepy.      0,3 eczh3g4
       I hated [NAME], but only because I thought he was good and played for the Cowboys. I feel the same way about [NAME] and [NAME].       0,3 eema2z5
