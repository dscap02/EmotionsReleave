                                                 Definitely. I cried. A lot. But if [NAME] existence has taught me anything, it‚Äôs to hold out hope!     20,25 ee8fllj
                                                If many people truly see that as a consequence, I'd suggest SD's public [NAME] needs some work. Sad.    20,25 eeb2idn
                             Sorry, I laughed, not at you, but because this is so perfect and so relatable. Hope you're past it or getting past it.   0,20,25 ed4tllh
